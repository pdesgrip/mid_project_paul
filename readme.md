An exmaination of bird sighting data for the Netherlands

Description: This project takes a closer look at the relationships between data for bird sightings in The Netherlands.

Questions:

1. What birds are the most frequently sighted in The Netherlands? What can we see if we look at sightings by days of the week?

2. Which areas in The Netherlands has more sightings and does the time of year have any significance (seasonality)?
   
3. Investigate the number of observations for the following types of the observation protocols (what the observer was doing): 
   Stationary, Travelling, Historical and Incidental. What do we learn?

4. Determine if there is a statistical dependency between birds observed and protocol type (the way they were observed). 
   Which statistical test should we use and why?

5. Is population in areas a significant predictor of no. of sightings? Perform OLS-regression and share insights.
